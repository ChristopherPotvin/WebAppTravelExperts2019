# WebAppTravelExperts2019
A web application that incorporates ASP, bootstrap, html, css, js and SQL/LINQ to query to a SQL DB. 

# Travel Experts Web Application
>ASP.NET project for a Travel Agency

This application was developed as a threaded project (phase 2) for a fictitious travel agency.
The application allows the user to perform CRUD operations on a cloud database.

This includes the creation of customer information via a customer registration form, a grouping of contact inquiries via a contact-us form, 
an email subscription feature and a secure login page that includes two-step identification via email confirmation. Furthermore the user must
be registered as a potential customer to access order information that is generated from the database. 

Additionally, numerous features have been incorporated into the project such Leaflet.JS and Mailgun along with various
bootstrap/css/js elements to create interactive content throughout the template. It is also dynamically responsive.

Finally it was also created to be a part of our overall business solution, along with our sister desktop application.
